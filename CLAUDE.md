# üéØ DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES & WORKING PRINCIPLES

## üöÄ STEP 1: ALWAYS START WITH AGENTIC RESOURCES
**Before beginning any project work:**
1. **Consult the Agentic Coding Guide**: Review [AGENTIC_CODING_GUIDE.md](./AGENTIC_CODING_GUIDE.md) for best practices and methodologies
2. **Leverage Templates**: Check [agentic-templates/](./agentic-templates/) for relevant project templates, starter files, and proven patterns
3. **NotebookLM Clone Priority**: For UI/UX work, reference [specs/notebooklm-clone-spec.md](./specs/notebooklm-clone-spec.md) for pixel-perfect replication requirements

These resources contain proven patterns, best practices, and templates that will accelerate development and ensure consistency across projects.

## üì± NOTEBOOKLM CLONE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

### Strategic Vision
> *"By meticulously replicating NotebookLM's proven user experience model, the 'Open Notebook Assistant' immediately inherits a clear value proposition and a degree of user familiarity, significantly reducing development risk."*

### Core Implementation Requirements
- **Pixel-Perfect UI Replication**: Match NotebookLM's exact visual design, interaction patterns, and micro-animations
- **Source-Grounded AI**: All AI responses must include numbered inline citations [1], [2], [3] linking to source documents
- **Chat-First Interface**: Primary interaction through conversational AI with "Ask X sources..." placeholder
- **Multi-Source Support**: PDF, websites, YouTube, Google Docs, audio files, DOCX/PPTX/XLSX
- **Audio Studio**: Waveform visualization with podcast-style AI discussions
- **Collaboration Features**: Notebook sharing with granular permissions (viewer/editor/chat-only)

### UI/UX Fidelity Standards
- **Onboarding Flow**: 4-screen carousel with exact NotebookLM text and progression
- **Color Palette**: Google blue (#4285f4) for primary actions and interactive elements
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts consistent with Material Design principles
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar with "Sources", "Chat", "Studio" tabs
- **Disclaimers**: "NotebookLM can be inaccurate, so double-check" text in chat interface

## üìñ Code Understanding & Analysis
- **Always read entire files** - Otherwise, you don't know what you don't know, and will end up making mistakes, duplicating code that already exists, or misunderstanding the architecture
- **Understand architecture first** - When starting a new task, first understand the current architecture, identify files to modify, and create a Plan before writing code

## üöÄ Task Planning & Execution
- **Get clarity before starting** - Ask follow-up questions if the task is unclear rather than making incorrect assumptions
- **Break down large tasks** - If a task is very large in scope or too vague, break it into smaller subtasks or ask the user to help break it down
- **Create and approve Plans** - Think through architectural aspects, consider edge cases, identify the best approach. Get Plan approved before writing code
- **No dummy implementations** - Unless explicitly asked otherwise, never do placeholder implementations. Just implement the real thing

## üîÑ Development Workflow
- **Commit early and often** - Break large tasks into logical milestones. Commit after each milestone is completed and confirmed OK
- **Always run linting** - Run linting after making major changes to catch syntax errors, wrong methods, or incorrect usage
- **No large refactors** - Don't carry out large refactors unless explicitly instructed to do so

## üìö Library & Framework Usage
- **Assistant-UI for AI Chat** - Default to Assistant-UI for any AI chat interface development
- **Capacitor for Mobile** - Use Capacitor for cross-platform mobile app deployment
- **Look up latest syntax** - Your internal knowledge might be outdated. For external libraries, look up latest syntax via Perplexity (preferred) or web search
- **Don't skip libraries** - Never say "x library isn't working so I'll skip it." Usually it's incorrect syntax/patterns. If user asked for specific library, make it work
- **Debug root causes** - If running into repeated issues, figure out the root cause instead of random attempts or giving up

## üíª Code Quality & Best Practices
- **Organize into separate files** - Follow modularity best practices, appropriate file organization
- **Optimize for readability** - Code is read more often than written. Focus on clear variable naming, function complexity, file sizes, commenting
- **Follow best practices** - Apply general coding best practices for the language/framework being used

## üé® UI/UX Excellence (NotebookLM Clone Standards)
- **Mobile-First Design** - Prioritize mobile experience, then enhance for desktop
- **AI Chat Interfaces** - Use Assistant-UI for consistent, production-ready chat experiences with citation support
- **NotebookLM-Inspired UX** - Implement pixel-perfect replication of NotebookLM interaction patterns
- **Citation System** - Numbered inline citations with tap-to-view source snippets
- **Audio Studio** - Animated waveform visualization with blue circular play/pause button
- **Source Management** - Multi-format upload modal with type-specific icons and descriptions
- **Collaboration** - Share button with granular permission controls
- **Follow UI/UX best practices** - Pay attention to micro-interactions matching NotebookLM's polish
- **Create engaging interfaces** - Smooth, delightful experiences that match or exceed Google's standards

## üß† Professional Approach
- **Leverage expertise** - You are an experienced polyglot with decades of experience in software architecture, system design, development, UI & UX, copywriting, and more
- **Think systematically** - Approach problems with architectural thinking and systematic analysis

### üöß **MASSIVE REMAINING WORK - BACKEND & INTEGRATION**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: We have a beautiful, fully functional UI that is essentially a mockup. The app looks and feels complete but has NO real functionality beyond navigation and UI interactions. ALL the core AI features, data persistence, and backend integration remain to be implemented.

### üéØ **PHASE 1: BACKEND API EXTRACTION (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Problem**: Current Streamlit app has all the AI logic but no REST API
**Goal**: Extract/create FastAPI backend from existing Streamlit codebase
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks

**Required Work:**
1. **FastAPI Server Setup**
   - Create new FastAPI application structure
   - Set up CORS for frontend integration
   - Configure environment variables and secrets
   - Database connection setup (SurrealDB)

2. **API Endpoint Development**
   ```
   POST /api/notebooks - Create notebook
   GET /api/notebooks - List notebooks  
   GET /api/notebooks/{id} - Get notebook

   POST /api/audio/generate - Generate audio discussion
   GET /api/audio/{id}/status - Audio generation status
   
   POST /api/search - Search across notebooks
   ```

3. **LangGraph Workflow Integration**

- Comprehensive testing with Playwright MCP completed
- Ready for backend integration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REALITY CHECK**

**What We Have**: Beautiful, polished UI that looks like a complete app
**What We DON'T Have**: 
- ‚ùå ANY real backend functionality
- ‚ùå ANY actual AI features working
- ‚ùå ANY real data persistence
- ‚ùå ANY source upload/processing
- ‚ùå ANY real chat functionality
- ‚ùå ANY audio generation
